# Kwasa-Kwasa: Metacognitive Text Processing Framework

<p align="center"><em>There is no reason for your soul to be misunderstood</em></p>

Kwasa-Kwasa is a revolutionary text processing framework that treats text as a first-class computational medium. It provides a complete environment where text becomes mathematically manipulable while preserving semantic meaning.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Kwasa-Kwasa
cargo install --path .

# Run your first Turbulance program
kwasa-kwasa run hello.turb
```

## Core Innovation: Text as Computational Medium

Kwasa-Kwasa transforms text processing by introducing **mathematical operations on text** with semantic awareness:

```turbulance
// Mathematical text operations
var sentences = paragraph / sentence    // Division: split into smaller units
var combined = sentence1 * sentence2    // Multiplication: intelligent combination
var extended = text + " more content"   // Addition: semantic concatenation
var filtered = text - "unwanted phrase" // Subtraction: content removal
```

## Turbulance: A Language for Text

Turbulance is a domain-specific language designed exclusively for text operations. It provides a rich, expressive syntax for text manipulation with semantic awareness.

### Key Language Features

- **Boundaries and Text Units**: Define and operate on specific text structures
- **Contextual Transformations**: Apply transformations based on semantic context
- **Knowledge Integration**: Connect with external research sources
- **State Management**: Maintain context across transformations
- **Semantic Operations**: Operate on text while preserving meaning

### Syntax Example

```turbulance
funxn enhance_paragraph(paragraph, domain="general"):
    within paragraph:
        given contains("technical_term"):
            research_context(domain)
            ensure_explanation_follows()
        given readability_score < 65:
            simplify_sentences()
            replace_jargon()
        return processed
```

### Language Structure

Turbulance's lexical structure includes:
- **Keywords**: `funxn`, `within`, `given`, `project`, `ensure`, `return`, etc.
- **Operators**: `/` (division), `*` (multiplication), `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction)
- **Control Structures**: Block expressions, conditional execution, iterations
- **Function System**: Declarations, parameters, closures, return values
- **Special Constructs**: `motion`, `proposition`, `cause`, `considering`, `allow`

### Standard Library

The Turbulance standard library provides built-in functions for text manipulation:

```turbulance
// Text analysis
readability_score(text)              // Returns Flesch-Kincaid score (0-100)
sentiment_analysis(text)             // Returns polarity and subjectivity
extract_keywords(text, count=10)     // Extracts significant keywords

// Text transformation

## Metacognitive Orchestration

The framework doesn't just process text; it understands your goals and guides the writing process through the Metacognitive Orchestrator.

### Orchestrator Features

- **Goal Representation**: Define and track writing objectives
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain knowledge of document state and domain
- **Intelligent Intervention**: Provide suggestions based on goals and context
- **Progress Evaluation**: Assess alignment with intended outcomes

### Goal-Oriented Writing

```turbulance
// Setting up a writing goal
var goal = new Goal("Write a technical tutorial for beginners", 0.4)
goal.add_keywords(["tutorial", "beginner", "step-by-step", "explanation"])

// Track progress towards the goal
goal.update_progress(0.3)  // 30% complete
goal.is_complete()         // Returns false

// Evaluating alignment with goals
var alignment = orchestrator.evaluate_alignment(text)
if alignment < 0.3:
    suggest_improvements()
```

### Advanced Processing Architecture

The Metacognitive Orchestrator implements a streaming-based concurrent processing model with three nested layers:

1. **Context Layer**: Establishes the relevant frame for processing
2. **Reasoning Layer**: Handles logical processing and analytical computation
3. **Intuition Layer**: Focuses on pattern recognition and heuristic reasoning

This architecture enables:
- Processing to begin before complete input is available
- Continuous refinement of results as more information becomes available
- Enhanced ability to handle complex, open-ended tasks

## Propositions and Motions

The most unique feature of Turbulance is the Proposition and Motion system for hypothesis-driven text processing.

### Propositions and Motions

Propositions are containers for related ideas that can be tested and validated:

```turbulance
proposition TextQuality:
    motion Clarity("Text should be clear and unambiguous")
    motion Conciseness("Text should be concise without losing meaning") 
    motion Accuracy("Text should be factually correct")
    
    // Test the motions against actual content
    within document:
        given readability_score() > 70:
            support Clarity
        given word_count() / idea_count() < 20:
            support Conciseness
        given fact_check_score() > 0.9:
            support Accuracy
```

### Motions

Motions are the fundamental building blocks within propositions:

```turbulance
// Working with motions directly
motion claim = Motion("Text should be programmatically manipulable", "claim")
motion evidence = Motion("Word processors lack semantic awareness", "evidence")

// Apply motion-specific analysis
spelling_issues = claim.spelling()
capitalization_issues = evidence.capitalization()

// Check for cognitive biases
if claim.check_sunken_cost_fallacy().has_bias:
    print("Warning: Potential sunken cost fallacy detected")
```

## Specialized Data Structures

The framework introduces data structures specifically for metacognitive text processing and scientific data analysis:

1. **TextGraph**: Represents relationships between text components as a weighted directed graph
2. **ConceptChain**: Represents sequences of ideas with cause-effect relationships
3. **IdeaHierarchy**: Organizes ideas in a hierarchical tree structure
4. **ArgMap**: Creates argumentation maps with claims, evidence, and objections
5. **EvidenceNetwork**: Implements a Bayesian framework for managing conflicting scientific evidence

```turbulance
// Create an evidence network for scientific analysis
var network = new EvidenceNetwork()

// Add nodes representing different types of evidence
network.add_node("genomic_1", EvidenceNode.GenomicFeature {
    sequence: dna_sequence,
    position: "chr7:55249071-55249143",
    motion: Motion("EGFR exon sequence with activating mutation")
})

network.add_node("spectrum_1", EvidenceNode.Spectra {
    peaks: mass_spec_peaks,
    retention_time: 15.7,
    motion: Motion("Mass spectrum showing drug metabolite")
})

// Add edges representing relationships between evidence
network.add_edge("genomic_1", "spectrum_1", EdgeType.Supports { strength: 0.85 }, 0.2)

// Propagate beliefs through the network
network.propagate_beliefs()

// Analyze sensitivity to understand which evidence is most critical
sensitivity = network.sensitivity_analysis("genomic_1")  // Returns impact scores
```

## Extended Language Syntax

Turbulance includes unique language constructs for text processing:

### 1. Considering Statements
Process collections contextually:

```turbulance
considering these paragraphs where contains("important"):
    highlight(paragraph)

considering all motions in this:
    check_spelling(motion)
    check_capitalization(motion)
```

### 2. Cause Declarations
Model relationships between concepts:

```turbulance
cause BiasedReasoning = {
    primary: "emotional investment",
    effects: ["selective evidence consideration", "overconfidence in judgment"],
    confidence: 0.75
}
```

### 3. Allow Statements
Control permissions for text transformations:

```turbulance
allow fact_checking on Abstract
allow sentiment_analysis on MainPoint
allow coherence_check on Conclusion
```

### 4. Within Contexts
Define processing scopes:

```turbulance
within document:
    // Document-level processing
    ensure_consistent_terminology()
    
    considering all section in document:
        // Section-level processing
        ensure_logical_flow()
```

## Text Unit Hierarchy

Text units exist in a natural hierarchy that can be mathematically manipulated:

```
Document
├── Section
│   ├── Paragraph
│   │   ├── Sentence
│   │   │   ├── Phrase
│   │   │   │   ├── Word
│   │   │   │   │   └── Character
```

### Mathematical Operations on Text Units

```turbulance
// Division: Split into smaller units
var sentences = paragraph / sentence
var words = sentence / word

// Multiplication: Combine with intelligent connectors  
var paragraph = sentence1 * sentence2 * sentence3

// Addition: Concatenate while preserving type
var extended = original_text + " additional content"

// Subtraction: Remove content while maintaining structure
var cleaned = text - "unwanted phrase"
```

## Domain Extensions

var gc_rich_regions = dna.filter("gc_content() > 0.6")

// Use propositions for genetic analysis
proposition GeneRegulation:
    motion Activation("Gene X activates Gene Y")
    motion Inhibition("Gene Z inhibits Gene X")
    
    within dna:
        given contains("TATAAA"):
            print("Found TATA box promoter")
            ensure_follows("Gene body")
```

// Apply text operations to molecules
var fragments = caffeine / functional_group
var aromatic_parts = caffeine.filter("is_aromatic() == true")

// Chemical analysis with propositions
proposition DrugLikeness:
    motion LipiniskiCompliant("Molecule follows Lipinski's Rule of Five")
    
    within caffeine:
        given molecular_weight() < 500:
            support LipiniskiCompliant
        given hydrogen_donors() <= 5:
            support LipiniskiCompliant
```

// Spectral analysis propositions
proposition CompoundIdentification:
    motion MolecularIon("Peak represents molecular ion")
    motion FragmentIon("Peak represents fragment ion")
    
    within spectrum:
        given peak_at_mz(molecular_weight):
            support MolecularIon
```

## Philosophy

Kwasa-Kwasa represents a fundamental shift in text processing philosophy. Traditional approaches treat text as strings to be manipulated. Kwasa-Kwasa treats text as a rich, semantic medium that can be mathematically manipulated while preserving meaning.

**Vision**: Create a computational environment where text becomes as manipulable as data structures in programming languages, while maintaining semantic richness and meaning.

*"There is no reason for your soul to be misunderstood"* - The core philosophy driving Kwasa-Kwasa's approach to making meaning computationally accessible. 

# Formal Specification: Probabilistic Points and Resolutions

## Abstract

This document formalizes a new paradigm for text processing that treats all textual elements as inherently uncertain "Points" and all operations as probabilistic "Resolutions". Unlike traditional deterministic text processing, this system acknowledges that meaning in natural language is fundamentally probabilistic and context-dependent.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Points

A **Point** is a variable representing textual content with inherent uncertainty.

#### Definition
```
Point := {
    content: Text,
    certainty: Probability ∈ [0, 1],
    context: ContextSpace,
    temporal_state: TimeStamp
}
```

#### Properties
- **No point is 100% certain** - All textual meaning contains some degree of uncertainty
- **Points exist in probability space** - They represent distributions of possible meanings
- **Points are context-dependent** - The same textual content can yield different points in different contexts
- **Points can evolve** - Their certainty and meaning can change as more information becomes available

#### Examples
```
point₁ = {
    content: "bank",
    certainty: 0.7,
    context: "financial_document",
    temporal_state: now()
}

point₂ = {
    content: "bank", 
    certainty: 0.6,
    context: "nature_description",
    temporal_state: now()
}
```

### 2. Resolutions

A **Resolution** is a probabilistic operation that processes points along with supporting evidence to produce new probabilistic outputs.

#### Definition
```
Resolution := Function(
    primary_point: Point,
    affirmations: Set<Evidence>,
    contentions: Set<CounterEvidence>,
    context: ContextSpace
) → ProbabilisticResult
```

#### Input Components

**Primary Point**: The main textual element being processed
- Contains the core content under analysis
- Has its own inherent uncertainty

**Affirmations**: Evidence that supports certain interpretations
- Contextual clues that strengthen particular meanings
- Prior knowledge that aligns with specific interpretations
- Corroborating textual evidence

**Contentions**: Evidence that challenges or weakens certain interpretations  
- Contextual information that contradicts specific meanings
- Counter-evidence from conflicting sources
- Ambiguity indicators that increase uncertainty

#### Output: ProbabilisticResult
```
ProbabilisticResult := {
    interpretations: List<WeightedInterpretation>,
    confidence_bounds: (lower: Probability, upper: Probability),
    resolution_strength: Probability,
    remaining_uncertainty: Probability,
    evidence_synthesis: EvidenceMap
}

WeightedInterpretation := {
    meaning: InterpretedContent,
    probability: Probability,
    supporting_evidence: List<Evidence>,
    conflicting_evidence: List<CounterEvidence>
}
```

## Mathematical Foundation

### Probability Space
All operations occur within a probability space Ω where:
- Each point p ∈ Ω has an associated probability measure μ(p) ∈ [0,1]  
- Resolutions are functions R: Ω × Evidence × Context → Ω
- The total probability across all possible interpretations sums to 1

### Uncertainty Propagation
When multiple points or evidence pieces are combined:
```
Combined_Uncertainty = f(
    point_uncertainty,
    affirmation_strength,
    contention_strength,
    evidence_conflicts
)
```

Where f is a function that accounts for:
- Constructive evidence (affirmations reduce uncertainty)
- Destructive evidence (contentions increase uncertainty)  
- Evidence conflicts (contradictions increase uncertainty)
- Context coherence (consistent context reduces uncertainty)

### Resolution Strength
Each resolution has an inherent strength based on:
- Quality of evidence provided
- Coherence between affirmations and contentions
- Contextual alignment
- Historical accuracy of similar resolutions

## Operational Framework

### 1. Point Creation
```
create_point(text_content, initial_context) → Point
```
- Takes raw text and context
- Assigns initial uncertainty based on content ambiguity
- Returns a Point ready for resolution

### 2. Evidence Gathering
```
gather_affirmations(point, knowledge_base) → Set<Evidence>
gather_contentions(point, knowledge_base) → Set<CounterEvidence>
```
- Automatically or manually collect supporting/opposing evidence
- Evidence can be textual, contextual, or meta-textual

### 3. Resolution Process
```
resolve(point, affirmations, contentions, context) → ProbabilisticResult
```
- Processes all inputs through probabilistic reasoning
- Applies Bayesian updating based on evidence
- Returns weighted interpretations with confidence measures

### 4. Result Interpretation
```
extract_most_likely(result) → WeightedInterpretation
extract_all_plausible(result, threshold) → List<WeightedInterpretation>
calculate_ambiguity(result) → Probability
```

## Types of Resolutions

### 1. Semantic Resolution
**Purpose**: Determine meaning of ambiguous text
```
semantic_resolve(
    point: "bank statement",
    affirmations: ["financial context", "numerical data present"],
    contentions: ["near river mentioned"],
    context: "business_document"
) → "financial record" (p=0.89), "river documentation" (p=0.11)
```

### 2. Sentiment Resolution  
**Purpose**: Determine emotional or attitudinal content
```
sentiment_resolve(
    point: "That's interesting",
    affirmations: ["positive context", "engaged tone"],
    contentions: ["formal setting", "brief response"],
    context: "professional_email"
) → "genuine_interest" (p=0.45), "polite_dismissal" (p=0.55)
```

### 3. Intent Resolution
**Purpose**: Determine intended action or purpose
```
intent_resolve(
    point: "Could you help me with this?",
    affirmations: ["urgent tone", "specific problem context"],
    contentions: ["indirect phrasing", "casual setting"],
    context: "colleague_communication"
) → "direct_request" (p=0.7), "casual_inquiry" (p=0.3)
```

### 4. Temporal Resolution
**Purpose**: Determine time-related meaning
```
temporal_resolve(
    point: "We'll do this soon",
    affirmations: ["deadline context", "urgency indicators"],
    contentions: ["vague phrasing", "no specific timeframe"],
    context: "project_management"
) → "within_week" (p=0.4), "within_month" (p=0.5), "indefinite" (p=0.1)
```

## Evidence Types

### Affirmations (Supporting Evidence)
1. **Contextual Affirmations**
   - Domain-specific terminology present
   - Consistent thematic elements
   - Appropriate register/formality level

2. **Structural Affirmations**  
   - Grammatical patterns supporting interpretation
   - Discourse markers indicating meaning
   - Punctuation and formatting cues

3. **Semantic Affirmations**
   - Related concepts in surrounding text
   - Coherent conceptual framework
   - Logical argument structure

4. **Pragmatic Affirmations**
   - Cultural context alignment
   - Situational appropriateness
   - Speaker/writer intention indicators

### Contentions (Counter-Evidence)
1. **Contextual Contentions**
   - Mixed domain signals
   - Inconsistent terminology
   - Conflicting contextual cues

2. **Ambiguity Contentions**
   - Multiple valid interpretations available
   - Unclear referents
   - Polysemous terms present

3. **Coherence Contentions**
   - Logical inconsistencies
   - Contradictory statements
   - Incomplete information

4. **Reliability Contentions**
   - Source credibility issues
   - Historical inaccuracy
   - Contradicts established knowledge

## Implementation Philosophy

### Design Principles

1. **Uncertainty is Fundamental**: Never pretend certainty where none exists
2. **Evidence-Driven**: All conclusions must be supported by explicit evidence
3. **Context-Aware**: Same text can have different meanings in different contexts
4. **Probabilistic Throughout**: No binary true/false - everything is probabilistic
5. **Transparent Reasoning**: Show how conclusions were reached
6. **Updateable**: New evidence can change previous conclusions

### Human-Like Reasoning

This system mimics how humans actually process text:
- We consider multiple possible meanings
- We weigh evidence for and against interpretations
- We remain uncertain when evidence is unclear
- We update our understanding as more information arrives
- We consider context heavily in interpretation

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Processing "The solution is optimal"

1. **Point Creation**
```
point = create_point("The solution is optimal", context="technical_document")
// Initial uncertainty: 0.3 (due to ambiguous terms)
```

2. **Evidence Gathering**
```
affirmations = [
    "mathematical context present",
    "optimization terminology used",
    "technical audience"
]

contentions = [
    "no specific metrics provided", 
    "subjective term 'optimal'",
    "could be business optimization vs mathematical"
]
```

3. **Resolution**
```
result = resolve(point, affirmations, contentions, "technical_document")

// Output:
interpretations = [
    {meaning: "mathematically optimal solution", probability: 0.6},
    {meaning: "best practical choice", probability: 0.3},
    {meaning: "subjective quality assessment", probability: 0.1}
]

confidence_bounds = (0.45, 0.75)
resolution_strength = 0.7
remaining_uncertainty = 0.3
```

4. **Application**
```
// For mathematical processing:
if extract_most_likely(result).meaning contains "mathematical"
    apply_mathematical_optimization_analysis()

// For uncertainty-aware display:
display("Solution optimality: " + result.confidence_bounds + " confidence")
```

## Advantages Over Traditional Approaches

1. **Honest About Uncertainty**: Acknowledges when we don't know
2. **Evidence-Based**: Conclusions are grounded in explicit reasoning
3. **Context-Sensitive**: Same text processed differently in different contexts
4. **Updatable**: Can incorporate new evidence
5. **Nuanced**: Captures subtle degrees of meaning
6. **Transparent**: Shows reasoning process
7. **Human-Like**: Reflects how humans actually understand text

## Future Research Directions

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train systems to better identify affirmations and contentions
2. **Context Modeling**: Develop sophisticated context representation systems
3. **Evidence Networks**: Model complex relationships between evidence pieces
4. **Temporal Dynamics**: Handle how meaning changes over time
5. **Multi-Modal**: Extend to non-textual evidence (images, audio, etc.)
6. **Collaborative Resolution**: Multiple agents contributing evidence and perspectives
7. **Meta-Resolution**: Resolutions about the quality of other resolutions

## Conclusion

This formal specification establishes a foundation for text processing that embraces uncertainty rather than hiding it. By treating text as inherently probabilistic and using evidence-based reasoning, we can build systems that more accurately reflect the complexity and nuance of human language understanding.

The key insight is that traditional deterministic text processing is fundamentally flawed because it assumes certainty where none exists. By building uncertainty into the foundation of our text processing systems, we can create more honest, nuanced, and ultimately more useful tools for working with natural language.
