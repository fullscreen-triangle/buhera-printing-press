**Abstract**

This work is based on ideas supported by some of the biologists who discovered foundational facts of twentieth-century biology and who argued that Maxwell's demons are physically implemented by biological devices. In particular, JBS Haldane first, and later J. Monod, A, Lwoff and F. Jacob argued that enzymes and molecular receptors implemented Maxwell's demons that operate in systems far removed from thermodynamic equilibrium and that were responsible for creating the biological order. Later, these ideas were extended to other biological processes. In this article, we argue that these biological Maxwell's demons \(BMD\) are systems that have information processing capabilities that allow them to select their inputs and direct their outputs toward targets. In this context, we propose the idea that these BMD are information catalysts in which the processed information has broad thermodynamic consequences.

In addition to we have biological objects whose existence demands a cost of the classic definition of "amount of information" proposed construction and eventually of operation \(e.g., enzymes that carry by Shannon \(1948\), the Wikipedia article "Information" out active transports, or in the case of memories, the cost of trans-
