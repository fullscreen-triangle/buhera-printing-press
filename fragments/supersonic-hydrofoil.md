# Introduction

The pursuit of speed in marine environments has traditionally faced
significant limitations due to water resistance and surface
irregularities. Current water speed records remain orders of magnitude
below sonic speeds, with the Spirit of Australia holding the record at
approximately 511 km h^−1^. This paper proposes a theoretical framework
for a vessel capable of achieving speeds 5-7 times greater by
fundamentally redefining the relationship between the vessel and its
medium.

Unlike conventional watercraft that remain in continuous contact with
the water surface, our proposed supersonic hydrofoil-to-ekranoplane
transition vehicle (SHETV) utilizes a fundamentally different
approach---transitioning from hydrofoil operation to ground effect
flight with minimal water contact, followed by rocket-powered
acceleration to supersonic speeds.

# System Overview

The SHETV system consists of three primary operational phases:

1.  Initial hydrofoil deployment phase

2.  Ground effect transition phase

3.  Supersonic flight phase

## Operational Environment Requirements

The system requires:

-   An extended water course of at least 100 km in length

-   Minimal surface waves (less than 0.5 m amplitude)

-   Restricted marine traffic zone

-   Monitoring stations at regular intervals

-   Recovery systems at the termination point

# Vehicle Design

## Structural Configuration

The vehicle adopts a delta-wing configuration with a distinctive
needle-like protrusion extending from its nose, similar to the
hypersonic ground effect vehicle design. The needle serves multiple
functions:

-   Creating a pressure cone ahead of the main body

-   Generating extreme dynamic pressure at its leading edge

-   Housing sensors for real-time environmental condition monitoring

-   Initiating ionization of ambient air

The body is designed with multiple separation points, allowing for
staged mass reduction as the vehicle accelerates---analogous to the
staging of orbital rockets.

## Hydrofoil System

The initial hydrofoil system features:

-   Multiple struts with hydrodynamically optimized cross-sections

-   Adaptive geometry that provides maximum lift during the transition
    phase

-   Ablative coatings to withstand brief high-speed water contact

-   Automatic separation mechanisms for jettisoning when no longer
    required

## Balloon Deployment System

The balloon deployment system is designed to position the vehicle
optimally for the initial hydrofoil phase:

-   Multiple high-strength balloons with controlled inflation

-   Precision positioning systems to achieve optimal hydrofoil depth

-   Rapid release mechanisms synchronized with propulsion initiation

-   Aerodynamic balloon shapes to minimize interference during
    separation

## Zero Moving Parts Philosophy

The absence of traditional marine propulsion systems (propellers, water
jets, etc.) eliminates multiple failure points and reduces drag. Initial
stability is provided by the hydrofoil system, with aerodynamic control
surfaces providing stability once the vehicle transitions to ground
effect flight.

## Propulsion System

The propulsion architecture employs three distinct stages:

### Stage 1: Initial Acceleration

Twin high-output solid rocket boosters provide initial thrust until the
vessel reaches sufficient speed for the hydrofoils to generate full
lift. These boosters are subsequently jettisoned to reduce mass.

### Stage 2: Transition Phase

A second pair of rockets with higher specific impulse activates,
accelerating the vehicle to speeds sufficient to achieve ground effect
flight (150 km h^−1^). These are ejected upon depletion.

### Stage 3: Sprint Phase

The final propulsion stage consists of:

-   A main rocket that detaches and accelerates ahead of the vehicle

-   This lead rocket serves to clear and ionize the air path

-   Specialized devices deployed to reduce drag in the vehicle's path

The vehicle itself continues primarily through inertia with
supplementary thrust derived from:

-   Dynamic pressure-driven systems

-   Ionization effects at the boundary layer

# Theoretical Basis

## Hydrofoil-to-Ekranoplane Transition

The transition from hydrofoil operation to ground effect flight follows
the relation:

$$L_{total} = L_{hydrofoil}(v) + L_{wing}(v,h)$$

Where $L_{hydrofoil}(v)$ represents the lift generated by the hydrofoils
as a function of velocity, and $L_{wing}(v,h)$ represents the
aerodynamic lift generated by the wings as a function of velocity and
height above the water surface.

As velocity increases, the relationship shifts from:
$$L_{hydrofoil} \gg L_{wing} \quad \text{(initial state)}$$

To: $$L_{wing} \gg L_{hydrofoil} \quad \text{(transition state)}$$

At which point the hydrofoils are jettisoned to reduce drag and mass.

## Ground Effect Enhancement

The ground effect enhancement follows the approximate relation:

$$\frac{L}{L_{\infty}} \approx 1 + \frac{c}{16h}$$

Where $L$ is the lift generated in ground effect, $L_{\infty}$ is the
lift generated out of ground effect, $c$ is the wing chord length, and
$h$ is the height above the surface.

## Dynamic Pressure Utilization

At supersonic speeds, the stagnation pressure at the needle tip follows
the relation:
$$p_0 = p_\infty \left(1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}$$

At Mach 3-5, this creates pressure differentials exceeding 50:1 between
the stagnation point and the low-pressure regions. These pressure
gradients are harnessed for:

### Closed-Loop Cooling System

The pressure differential drives a refrigeration cycle without
mechanical compressors:

-   Working fluid (nitrogen) is compressed at the high-pressure
    stagnation region

-   Compressed fluid circulates through critical thermal management
    areas

-   Expansion through specialized nozzles provides cooling effect

-   The cycle is self-regulating: higher speeds generate greater cooling
    capacity

### Secondary Propulsion

The same pressure differential powers a secondary propulsion system:
$$F_{pressure} = \int_{S} (p - p_\infty) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS$$

## Surface Ionization System

Surface ionization is achieved through:

-   High-voltage discharges at specific locations on the vehicle surface

-   Plasma-generating materials incorporated into the vehicle skin

-   Interactions with the pre-ionized air path created by the lead
    rocket

The ionized boundary layer serves multiple functions:

-   Reduction of skin friction through electromagnetic interactions

-   Thermal insulation via altered thermal conductivity of the plasma
    layer

-   Stabilization of the boundary layer to prevent turbulent transition

# Theoretical Performance Profile

## Hydrofoil Phase

The initial hydrofoil phase occupies less than 25% of the total run
distance, with the acceleration profile modeled as:
$$a(t) = \frac{T(t) - D_{water}(v) - D_{air}(v,\rho)}{m(t)}$$

Where $T(t)$ represents the time-varying thrust, $D_{water}(v)$
represents the water drag as a function of velocity, $D_{air}(v,\rho)$
represents the air drag as a function of velocity and air density, and
$m(t)$ represents the time-varying mass as stages are jettisoned.

## Ground Effect Phase

As the vehicle transitions to ground effect flight, the hydrofoils are
jettisoned and the acceleration profile transitions to:
$$a(t) = \frac{T(t) - D_{air}(v,\rho,h)}{m(t)}$$

Where $D_{air}(v,\rho,h)$ now includes the reduced drag benefits of
ground effect flight at height $h$ above the water surface.

## Peak Velocity Phase

The peak velocity is theoretically achieved at approximately the 70 km
mark, with the vehicle having shed approximately 75% of its initial
mass. At this point, the remaining structure is a minimal,
aerodynamically optimized module containing:

-   Critical sensor systems

-   Telemetry equipment

-   Minimal aerodynamic control surfaces

This module maintains momentum through the low-density corridor created
by the preceding systems, with calculated maximum velocity approaching
Mach 3-5.

## Deceleration Phase

Deceleration occurs primarily through:

-   Gradual increase in altitude to reduce ground effect benefits

-   Controlled aerodynamic drag through variable surface configurations

-   Deployment of specialized high-speed drag devices

-   Final water contact (if necessary) through specialized impact
    absorption systems

# Control Systems

The vehicle is remotely operated by a team of specialists including:

-   Propulsion engineers

-   Hydrodynamics specialists

-   Aerodynamics experts

-   Thermal management specialists

-   Trajectory analysts

-   Emergency response coordinators

Control is maintained through:

-   Distributed sensor networks along the course

-   Real-time telemetry from the vehicle

-   Predictive modeling systems with millisecond-scale updates

-   Autonomous emergency response protocols

-   Marine recovery systems

# Engineering Challenges and Solutions

    strength-to-weight ratio

# Comparative Advantages Over Traditional Ekranoplanes

Monster\" or the A-90 Orlyonok, utilized conventional jet or turboprop
engines and achieved speeds of approximately 400 km h^−1^. The proposed

demonstrate the potential for revolutionary advances in transportation
technology.

hydrofoil-to-ekranoplane transition vehicle capable of achieving speeds
up to Mach 3-5. While significant engineering challenges remain, the
fundamental physical principles are sound. The proposed system
represents a convergence of hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, thermodynamics,
materials science, and propulsion technology pushed to theoretical
limits.

The primary purpose of this work is to stimulate academic discussion
regarding the ultimate physical limitations of human-engineered
transport systems and to identify promising avenues for further research
in extreme performance regimes, particularly at the intersection of
marine and aerospace technologies.
