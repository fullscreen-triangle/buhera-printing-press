# Chapter 18: Hypersonic Ground Effect Vehicle

## Introduction to Land Speed Limitations

Current land speed records remain significantly below hypersonic regimes, with the ThrustSSC holding the official record at 1,227.985 km/h (Mach 1.02). By fundamentally redefining the vehicle-environment relationship, theoretical analysis suggests potential speeds of Mach 15 (â‰ˆ18,500 km/h) through a novel hypersonic ground effect vehicle (HGEV).
