# The Dance of Death: Economic Interdependence and the Logical Impossibility of Fair War

## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel philosophical framework examining the logical contradictions inherent in attempts to formalize "fair war" in economically interdependent systems. Using the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a case study, we demonstrate that the procedural requirements for legitimizing modern warfare create conditions that simultaneously make such warfare logically incoherent. We introduce the "Dance of Death" metaphor to illustrate how nations engaged in formalized conflict while maintaining economic interdependence are trapped in a paradoxical arrangement where the very conditions required for "fair" conflict are identical to those that would make conflict unnecessary. Through game theoretical modeling and philosophical analysis, we demonstrate that the procedural legitimacy required by modern warfare creates a system where isolated destruction becomes impossible without triggering collective catastrophe.

# Introduction

The concept of "fair" or "just" war has evolved dramatically throughout human history. From the *jus ad bellum* principles articulated by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas to the Geneva Conventions and modern international humanitarian law, humanity has consistently sought to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate violence. This evolution reflects a persistent desire to maintain moral boundaries even within the inherently destructive practice of warfare.

The 20th century witnessed unprecedented attempts to formalize and proceduralize warfare. The Hague Conventions (1899, 1907), Geneva Protocols, and establishment of international tribunals represent attempts to subject warfare to legal and procedural constraints. These developments reflect what Habermas termed the "proceduralization of legitimacy" - the notion that legitimacy increasingly derives from adherence to recognized procedures rather than substantive outcomes.

Concurrent with the proceduralization of warfare, the global economy has become increasingly interconnected. As Keohane and Nye observed in their seminal work on complex interdependence, modern states are linked through multiple channels including trade, finance, and information flows. This interdependence has fundamentally altered the context in which warfare occurs.

Traditional theories of economic interdependence, from Kant's "Perpetual Peace" (1795) to contemporary liberal internationalism, have focused primarily on whether interdependence reduces the likelihood of conflict. However, these theories have not adequately addressed how economic interdependence affects the logical coherence of "fair war" concepts when conflicts do occur.

This paper addresses a fundamental question: Does economic interdependence create logical contradictions in the concept of "fair war"? We argue that it does, and introduce a novel metaphor—the "Dance of Death"—to illustrate this paradox. Like medieval dancers circling a grave while holding hands, modern nations engaged in conflict remain bound by economic ties that make isolated destruction logically impossible. The attempt to push one dancer into the grave inevitably pulls all participants down together.

# Theoretical Framework

## Just War Theory in the Modern Context

Just War Theory has traditionally been divided into *jus ad bellum* (justice in going to war), *jus in bello* (justice in conducting war), and more recently, *jus post bellum* (justice after war). Each component attempts to establish criteria for determining when and how warfare can be considered morally justified.

Walzer argues that just war requires adherence to principles of discrimination, proportionality, and military necessity. Similarly, Rawls contends that "well-ordered peoples" may engage in war only for self-defense and must observe strict limitations on conduct. These theories presuppose that warfare can be morally constrained through procedural mechanisms.

However, contemporary just war theory has not fully grappled with the implications of economic interdependence. When nations are economically intertwined, traditional conceptions of discrete harm become problematic. The ability to isolate damage to legitimate military targets—a core requirement of just war theory—becomes logically impossible when economic systems are interconnected.

## Economic Interdependence Theory

Economic interdependence theory has roots in Kantian liberalism, which posited that commercial relationships between states would reduce incentives for conflict. Modern articulations by Oneal and Russett and others have provided empirical support for the "commercial peace" hypothesis, suggesting that trade relationships reduce the likelihood of interstate warfare.

However, these theories typically focus on conflict initiation rather than the logical coherence of warfare once begun. Rosecrance noted that increasing interdependence makes traditional territorial conquest less profitable, but did not fully explore how interdependence affects the logical structure of warfare itself.

World-systems theorists like Wallerstein have highlighted how global economic structures create core-periphery relationships that shape conflict patterns. Yet these analyses have not addressed the specific procedural paradoxes that emerge when economically interdependent nations attempt to engage in "fair" warfare.

## The Procedural Paradox Framework

We introduce a novel theoretical framework—the Procedural Paradox—to analyze the logical contradictions inherent in attempts to conduct "fair war" in economically interdependent systems. This framework consists of four key components:

### Procedural Legitimacy Requirements

Modern warfare requires adherence to procedural norms to be considered legitimate. These include:

- Documentation and verification of military targets
- Proportionality assessments
- Distinction between military and civilian infrastructure
- Third-party monitoring and verification

### Economic Interdependence Constraints

Contemporary economic systems are characterized by:

- Complex supply chains spanning multiple nations
- Energy dependencies that cross conflict lines
- Financial systems with multilateral entanglements
- Information infrastructure with distributed architecture

### Documentation Impossibility

The procedural requirements for documenting and verifying legitimate military targets become logically impossible when those targets are embedded in interdependent economic systems. To document a target requires:

- Establishing its military purpose
- Demonstrating proportionality of attack
- Verifying limited civilian impact

When economic systems are interconnected, these requirements cannot be satisfied simultaneously.

### Third-Party Entanglement

The procedural legitimacy of modern warfare requires third-party verification, yet economic interdependence ensures that no true "third parties" exist. All potential verifiers are economically entangled with the conflict participants, creating inherent conflicts of interest that undermine the verification process.

# The Dance of Death: A Philosophical Metaphor

## Historical Context of the Danse Macabre

The Danse Macabre (Dance of Death) emerged as an artistic genre in late medieval Europe, depicting death leading people from all social classes in a dance toward the grave. As Oosterwijk notes, these artistic representations served as memento mori—reminders of mortality—while also emphasizing the universality of death across social boundaries.

The traditional Danse Macabre depicted figures arranged in a hierarchical line, from pope and emperor to peasant and infant, all led by the figure of Death. Our metaphorical adaptation transforms this linear procession into a circle, with participants holding hands around a central grave.

## The Dance of Death as Philosophical Metaphor

We propose the "Dance of Death" as a metaphor for the paradoxical nature of warfare in economically interdependent systems. In this metaphor:

- Nations are dancers circling a grave
- Economic ties are represented by joined hands
- The grave represents potential catastrophic destruction
- The dance represents the formalized procedures of "fair war"
- The impossibility of pushing one dancer in without all falling represents the paradox of isolated destruction

This metaphor illustrates how the procedural requirements for legitimate warfare create a system where isolated destruction becomes logically impossible. The very act of documenting, verifying, and legitimizing warfare requires economic connections that ensure mutual vulnerability.

## Formal Representation of the Dance of Death

The Dance of Death metaphor can be formalized using graph theory and game theory. Let $N = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$ represent the set of nations in the "dance." Let $C_{ij}$ represent the economic connection between nations $i$ and $j$. Let $H_{ij} = 1$ if nations $i$ and $j$ are "holding hands" in the economic dance, 0 otherwise.

The "dance around the pit" can be formalized as a graph $G = (N, E)$ where $E = \{(i,j) | H_{ij} = 1\}$.

For any nation $i$, the set of nations that fall if $i$ falls is given by the connected component containing $i$ in graph $G$.

The paradox emerges when we consider that for any "fair war" between nations $i$ and $j$, we require $H_{ij} = 1$ directly or indirectly, which ensures that if either falls, both fall.

# Case Study: The Russia-Ukraine-Germany Triangle

## Background of Economic Interdependence

The Russia-Ukraine-Germany economic triangle provides a compelling illustration of the Dance of Death paradox. Prior to the 2022 conflict, these three nations were bound in a complex web of economic interdependence:

- Russia supplied approximately 55% of Germany's natural gas imports
- Ukraine served as a transit country for Russian gas to Europe
- Germany was a major supplier of industrial equipment and technology to both Russia and Ukraine
- Ukrainian agricultural exports were significant to both German and Russian markets

This economic interdependence created a situation where the procedural requirements for "fair war" between Russia and Ukraine necessarily involved Germany as an economically entangled third party.

## The Procedural Paradox in Action

The Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrates the procedural paradox in several ways:

### Documentation and Verification

For Ukraine to document and verify legitimate military targets in Russia, it requires:

- Intelligence capabilities (often provided by third parties)
- Communication infrastructure (dependent on international networks)
- Verification mechanisms (requiring third-party involvement)

These requirements create economic dependencies that undermine the very possibility of isolated conflict.

### Energy and Economic Flows

The continued flow of Russian gas through Ukrainian pipelines to European markets during active conflict represents a stark illustration of the paradox. The procedural requirements for "fair war" demand that:

- Civilian infrastructure be protected
- Economic damage be proportionate
- Third-party interests be respected

Yet these requirements create a situation where Ukraine must protect the very infrastructure that finances the Russian military operations against it.

## Mathematical Formulation of the Paradox

Let:
$$\begin{aligned}
P_R &= \text{Russian gas production capacity} \\
T_U &= \text{Ukrainian transit capacity} \\
M_G &= \text{German manufacturing capacity} \\
E_G &= \text{German energy consumption} \\
A_U &= \text{Ammunition supplied to Ukraine}
\end{aligned}$$

The "fair war" constraint requires:
$$\begin{aligned}
A_U &= f(M_G, E_G) \\
E_G &= g(P_R, T_U) \\
\end{aligned}$$

Creating the circular dependency:
$$\begin{aligned}
A_U &= f(M_G, g(P_R, T_U)) \\
\end{aligned}$$

The paradox emerges when we consider that maximizing $A_U$ requires maximizing $P_R$ and $T_U$, meaning:
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial A_U}{\partial P_R} > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial A_U}{\partial T_U} > 0
\end{aligned}$$

This creates the logical contradiction where Russia must maximize gas production and Ukraine must maximize transit to enable maximum ammunition production against Russian forces.

## Game Theoretical Analysis

The Russia-Ukraine-Germany triangle can be analyzed as a three-player game with incomplete information. Each player has strategies available:

- Russia: Continue Gas Supply, Restrict Gas Supply
- Ukraine: Continue Transit, Block Transit
- Germany: Supply Weapons, Restrict Weapons

The Nash equilibrium analysis reveals that no stable equilibrium exists that satisfies the procedural requirements for "fair war." Any strategy profile that allows for legitimate conflict simultaneously creates economic conditions that undermine the conflict's logical coherence.

# Philosophical Implications

## The Logical Impossibility of Fair War

Our analysis demonstrates that "fair war" becomes logically impossible in economically interdependent systems. The procedural requirements for legitimizing warfare—documentation, verification, proportionality, and third-party monitoring—cannot be satisfied when economic systems are interconnected.

This conclusion extends beyond mere practical difficulties to a fundamental logical contradiction. The very conditions that would make warfare "fair" according to contemporary just war theory simultaneously make it logically incoherent.

## Procedural Legitimacy and Substantive Contradiction

The proceduralization of warfare legitimacy creates a paradoxical situation where adherence to procedure undermines the substantive goals of the procedure itself. This reflects a broader tension identified by Habermas between procedural and substantive conceptions of legitimacy.

In the context of warfare, procedural legitimacy requires documentation, verification, and third-party monitoring—all of which necessitate economic connections that make isolated harm impossible. The procedure designed to limit harm thus creates conditions that ensure mutual vulnerability.

## Implications for Just War Theory

Our analysis challenges fundamental assumptions in just war theory. Traditional conceptions of proportionality, discrimination, and military necessity presuppose the possibility of isolated harm. When economic systems are interconnected, these concepts become logically problematic.

Just war theorists must reconsider:

- The concept of proportionality in interconnected systems
- The possibility of discrimination between military and civilian targets
- The role of third parties in legitimizing conflict

## Beyond Liberal Internationalism

Our analysis extends beyond traditional liberal internationalist claims about economic interdependence reducing conflict likelihood. While Oneal and Russett and others have demonstrated correlations between trade and peace, our argument is stronger: economic interdependence makes "fair war" logically impossible, not merely unlikely.

This has implications for international relations theory more broadly, suggesting that the proceduralization of warfare in an interdependent world has created a fundamental logical contradiction that cannot be resolved within existing theoretical frameworks.

# Practical Implications

## For International Law

International humanitarian law has evolved to proceduralize warfare, establishing criteria for legitimate targets and proportionate response. Our analysis suggests that these procedural mechanisms become self-contradictory in economically interdependent systems.

Legal frameworks must be reconsidered to address:

- The impossibility of truly independent verification
- The logical contradictions in proportionality assessments
- The entanglement of civilian and military infrastructure

## For Diplomatic Practice

Diplomatic efforts to manage conflict must recognize the logical contradictions inherent in attempts to proceduralize "fair war." This suggests:

- Greater emphasis on conflict prevention rather than conflict management
- Recognition of the impossibility of truly "surgical" strikes in interconnected systems
- Development of new frameworks for addressing grievances that acknowledge economic interdependence

## For Economic Policy

Economic policy must account for the paradoxical relationship between interdependence and conflict:

- Strategic interdependence creates mutual vulnerability that may deter conflict initiation
- However, once conflict begins, interdependence creates logical contradictions in attempts to limit harm
- Economic policy should therefore focus on creating forms of interdependence that maximize deterrence while minimizing paradoxical entanglements

# Conclusion

This paper has introduced a novel philosophical framework—the Dance of Death—to analyze the logical contradictions inherent in attempts to conduct "fair war" in economically interdependent systems. Like medieval dancers circling a grave while holding hands, modern nations engaged in conflict remain bound by economic ties that make isolated destruction logically impossible.

Our analysis demonstrates that the procedural requirements for legitimizing warfare—documentation, verification, proportionality, and third-party monitoring—cannot be satisfied when economic systems are interconnected. This creates a fundamental logical contradiction: the very conditions that would make warfare "fair" according to contemporary just war theory simultaneously make it logically incoherent.

This conclusion has profound implications for just war theory, international law, diplomatic practice, and economic policy. It suggests that the proceduralization of warfare in an interdependent world has created a paradox that cannot be resolved within existing theoretical frameworks.

Future research should explore:

- Alternative frameworks for managing international grievances that acknowledge the logical impossibility of "fair war"
- The implications of the Dance of Death metaphor for other areas of international relations
- Empirical testing of the procedural paradox framework across different conflict scenarios

The Dance of Death metaphor offers a powerful lens for understanding the paradoxical nature of modern conflict. As nations continue to dance around the grave of potential catastrophe, recognizing the logical impossibility of pushing one dancer in without all falling may be crucial to avoiding collective destruction.
