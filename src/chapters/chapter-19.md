# Chapter 19: Hypersonic Individual Re-entry System

## Introduction to Re-entry Challenges

Current re-entry systems for returning astronauts from low Earth orbit rely on large capsules or spacecraft with complex heat shields, guidance systems, and parachute recovery mechanisms. While effective, these systems are designed for multiple occupants and cannot be deployed on an individual basis in emergency scenarios. The Individual Re-entry System (IRS) represents a theoretical framework for safely returning a single human from altitudes up to 200 km, achieving maximum velocities of Mach 7-8 during the descent phase.

# Hypersonic Individual Re-entry System: Breaking the Orbital Return Barrier

## System Architecture

### 1. Primary Components
1. Dynamic pressure needle system for thermal management and initial deceleration
2. High-density initial mass system that sheds progressively
3. Tree-structured redundant parachute deployment system
4. Ground-based control and monitoring system

### 2. Theoretical Framework

#### Ballistic Trajectory Optimization
The initial descent phase from 200 km altitude follows a ballistic trajectory optimized for maximum velocity accumulation. The governing equations of motion in the exoatmospheric phase are:

$$\frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} = -\frac{GM_E}{r^3}\vec{r}$$

Where $\vec{r}$ is the position vector from Earth's center, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $M_E$ is Earth's mass.

The intentional mass-forward design creates a high ballistic coefficient according to:

$$\beta = \frac{m}{C_D A}$$

Where $\beta$ is the ballistic coefficient, $m$ is mass, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, and $A$ is the reference area.

#### Dynamic Pressure Utilization
At hypersonic speeds, the stagnation pressure at the needle tip follows:

$$\frac{p_0}{p_\infty} = \left(1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}$$

This extreme pressure differential drives the thermal management system through:

$$\dot{W}_{\text{compression}} = \dot{m}_{\text{coolant}} \cdot v_{\text{coolant}} \cdot \Delta p$$

#### Mass Shedding Profile
The system's mass profile follows a planned reduction curve:

$$m(h) = m_0 - \int_{h_0}^{h} f_{\text{shed}}(h') \, dh'$$

#### Tree-Structured Parachute System
The parachute deployment follows a mathematical tree structure with increasingly fine-grained deceleration:

$$a_{\text{deceleration}}(h) = \frac{C_D \rho(h) v^2(h) A_{\text{chute}}(h)}{2 m(h)}$$

## Detailed System Components

### 1. Dynamic Pressure Thermal Management System

#### Components Table
| Component | Material | Function |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Needle Tip | Refractory metals (W-Re alloys, TZM) | Primary pressure capture |
| Pressure Channels | Nickel superalloys | Pressure distribution |
| Coolant System | Closed-loop nitrogen circuit | Thermal management |
| Thrust Redirection | Variable geometry nozzles | Attitude control and braking |
| Structural Integration | Carbon-carbon composites | System support and integration |

The cooling capacity scales with velocity according to:

$$\dot{Q}_{\text{cooling}} = \dot{m}_{\text{coolant}} \cdot \Delta h_{\text{cycle}}$$

### 2. Parachute Deployment Sequence

| Altitude (km) | Parachute Type | Quantity | Diameter (m) |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| 30 | Drogue (stabilization) | 2 | 1.5 |
| 29 | Secondary drogue | 2 | 2.0 |
| 28 | Tertiary drogue | 2 | 2.5 |
| 25 | Pilot chutes | 2 | 3.0 |
| 20 | Initial deceleration | 2 | 4.0 |
| 15 | Secondary deceleration | 2 | 5.0 |
| 10 | Tertiary deceleration | 2 | 6.0 |
| 5 | Main parachutes | 2 | 8.0 |
| 2 | Backup main parachutes | 2 | 8.0 |

## Theoretical Performance Profile

### 1. Exoatmospheric Phase
From release at 200 km altitude, the system accelerates under gravitational influence according to:

$$v_{\text{impact}} = \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2gh}$$

Without atmospheric resistance, a theoretical velocity of approximately 2 km/s would be achieved. Atmospheric effects reduce this to a maximum velocity of approximately Mach 7-8 (2.4-2.7 km/s).

### 2. Entry Interface and Thermal Management
The entry interface occurs at approximately 80-100 km altitude, with peak heating occurring between 60-70 km. The theoretical heat management capability follows:

$$\dot{Q}_{\text{managed}} = \eta_{\text{system}} \cdot \dot{Q}_{\text{incident}}$$

### 3. Transition and Braking Phase
Between 60 km and 30 km, the dynamic pressure system provides braking force by redirecting high-pressure air through forward-facing nozzles:

$$F_{\text{braking}} = \dot{m}_{\text{air}} \cdot (v_{\text{exit}} - v_{\text{vehicle}})$$
