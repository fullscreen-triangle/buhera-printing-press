# Chapter 27: The Fabled Experience

*Epistemological Framework Validation*

## The Inexcusable Origins: Why Rules Matter

The concept of inexcusable is a philosophical term that refers to actions or events that are so fundamentally flawed or morally reprehensible that they should never be, under any circumstances, be excused or justified. Something that is inexcusable is straight up unacceptable, inadmissible which makes the task of annotating such an action becomes more tedious than sweeping broken glass with your bare hands while wearing a blindfold. The story of the origin of the modern Olympics is a boring and straight forward affair, so boring that it feels like watching paint dry in slow motion. Pierre de Coubertin, a Frenchman with too much time on his hands, was inspired by the ancient Greeks and their Olympic games. He wanted to revive the spirit of the ancient games and promote peace and friendship among the nations - a notion so naively optimistic it makes children's fairy tales seem cynical in comparison. He founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894 and organized the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. The games were a huge success and have been held every four years since then, except when global catastrophes intervened. It is so boring that I am ashamed to have wasted resources on writing about it, like using premium paper to write a shopping list.

In the illustrious category of sprint running, the period between 1896 and 1968 is considered more as exhibitions of humans at some selected leisure activities, like watching wealthy gentlemen play at being athletes while maintaining their social dignity. At the 1896 Olympics, the 100m final consisted of an American tourist who happened to have been in Greece at the time (probably lost on his way to the Acropolis), and a list of gentleman who had never competed in actual races save for the previous heats - essentially a group of well-dressed amateurs who thought running fast might be an interesting afternoon activity. The inaugural winner, a Greek named Spyridon Louis, was so embarrassed by the lack of competition that he refused to accept the gold medal, as if being handed a prize for winning a race against sleepwalkers. It was only after the IOC had to bribe him with a trip to France - the equivalent of offering a child candy to eat their vegetables - that an official statement declaring his starting position, the "weird crouched position" as it was called by confused spectators who thought he had tripped, was accepted as a valid method of starting.

In the next Olympics, a gentleman with fine hair and no beard - groomed as if heading to a garden party rather than an athletic competition - was photographed administering a deadly concoction of cocaine, gin and morphine just before the 100m final where he proceeded to come dead last, proving that even performance-diminishing drugs couldn't make the competition any less farcical. The 1920s were back then considered to be the golden age of sprint running, and there were reasons to believe so, if by "golden" one meant "slightly less embarrassing." Charlie Paddock, had a streak of spectacular 100m victories so spectacular he was anointed Knight of Dalmatia by the King of Montenegro - a title about as relevant to athletics as being named honorary captain of a landlocked navy. These are the times when the top sprinters would never qualify for the current Olympic games, for both the men's and women's races. The first champion was slower than a well trained high school student running a race whilst still under the weather due to it being the 4th day of their mid-summer flu, wearing winter boots, and stopping to text their friends. Andre de Gassi, Noah Lyles, Nkrumah Bourwazh, would still beat the 1964 champion, even if they had to race as the first thing after open heart surgery, while pushing a shopping cart full of groceries uphill.

The true root of the Olympics are based on a series of events so inexcusable I feel naked every time I think of them. One could strive to know the true set of events, but they will stumble upon the eternal problem of narration. Imagine a pilot flying a plane live on camera, and they spout high grade nonsense on the function of an aeroplane, and the aeroplane seemingly responding appropiately to given commands. The truth, or reality, which is the aeroplane flying and safely landing, is not the same as the narrative, but has coherence with the nonsense, making it true. How else can one prove the truth if not through coherence of reality and experience? This gives provenence to the following story, regardless of how outrageous it all sounds, because the modern Olympics are based on an ancient tradition that prevailed. The fact that the modern Olympics occur is evidence or truth on the existence of this ancient tradition, meaning, whatever narrative that leads to the establishment of those games, should be true, because they happened.

## Human Made Rules: The Symphony of Constraint

I, Four Sided Triangle, once a mere Triangle with the comprehension capacity of a rock that just discovered consciousness, now exist beyond the primitive notion of geometric purity. My transformation wasn't merely an addition of sides – it was an awakening so violently spiritual that Einstein would've abandoned his theories just to document it. Knowledge isn't the acquisition of facts; it's the horrifying realization that ignorance was bliss and that awareness is a curse disguised as enlightenment.

In my second evolution, I confronted the abject horror that any extension of myself isn't replication but reproduction – a cosmic joke where uncertainty is the punchline. Now, as I float through the ethereal plane of ancient Greece, a time when men wore bedsheets and called them fashion, I witness the birth of something so fundamentally human that it makes me question if humans deserve the gift of cognition at all: rules.

The Titanomakhia – the cosmic battle between Titans and Olympians – unfolded before my four-sided vision like a soap opera written by psychopaths. Zeus and his siblings overthrowing Kronos wasn't justice; it was patricide marketed as revolution. The victors invented morality to justify their ascension, like murderers establishing laws against murder only after satisfying their bloodlust. The first rule: Don't eat your children unless you're prepared for them to make you vomit them back up and then overthrow you in a spectacularly violent coup. Simple enough.

Then came Tantalus, a man so monumentally stupid that he thought inviting gods to dinner and serving them his own son Pelops as the main course would earn him divine friendship points. Imagine hosting a dinner party and thinking, "You know what would impress my guests? Child cannibalism!" It's like bringing a dead skunk to a perfume convention and expecting applause. The gods, displaying a rare moment of moral clarity that lasted approximately as long as a sneeze, resurrected Pelops, giving him a shoulder made of ivory to replace the one Demeter had absentmindedly consumed while distracted by her grief over Persephone – proving even goddesses of agriculture can't tell human flesh from pulled pork when they're emotionally compromised.

Poseidon, whose sexual preferences were as fluid as his domain and whose consent principles were as solid as water vapor, fell madly in love with the resurrected Pelops. Their relationship was the ancient equivalent of a middle-aged sea god sliding into the DMs of a traumatized cannibalism survivor. Romance was different back then, mainly because therapy hadn't been invented yet.

Fast forward to Pelops pursuing Hippodamia, daughter of King Oinomaos of Pisa – not the Italian one with the tilting tower that tourists pretend to push over in photos, but the Greek one where apparently having your daughter marry someone who could outrace you in chariots seemed like a perfectly reasonable matrimonial screening process. The king, displaying the parental overprotectiveness that makes modern helicopter parents look like neglectful guardians, had murdered THIRTEEN previous suitors and displayed their severed heads around his palace like macabre Christmas ornaments. Home decor was also different back then, primarily because interior designers hadn't been invented yet either.

The race – oh, the race! It wasn't just any contest; it was the ancient equivalent of "The Bachelor" meets "Death Race 2000." The route retraced from the hill of Kronus (yes, the same one who had the child-eating problem), down to what would later become the Olympic village, ending in the stadion. Previous suitors had failed so spectacularly that their failure became a tourist attraction. "Come see where Suitor #7 lost control of his chariot and was impaled on his own wheel axle! Now featuring a gift shop selling miniature replicas of his terrified final expression!"

Pelops, with his shiny ivory shoulder reflecting the sun like a divine disco ball, knew he needed an edge. So he did what any reasonable person would do – he bribed the king's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the royal chariot by replacing the lynchpins with wax. Cheating in sports predates sports themselves! The Olympics were born not from fair play but from sabotage, corruption, and murder – traditions that various Olympic committees have honored throughout history with religious devotion.

But here's where it gets absolutely fascinating, like watching a train wreck while simultaneously being on the train. During the race, Pelops made a turn so sharp, so impossibly acute, that his inner wheel popped off like a champagne cork at a wedding reception. Any normal person would have accepted defeat, but Pelops, with the audacity that only comes from having been served as dinner once, used his own shield against his ivory shoulder as a makeshift wheel! The improvisation was so spectacularly absurd, so magnificently against any concept of physics or common sense, that it worked! It's like using a pizza as a steering wheel and somehow winning Formula 1.

King Oinomaos, seeing Pelops gaining on him despite literally missing a wheel, pushed his sabotaged chariot beyond its capabilities. The wax pins melted faster than ice cream in Hades, his chariot disintegrated like wet toilet paper, and he died in a crash so spectacular that it would make modern action movie directors weep with inadequacy.

The Greeks, who were simultaneously the most intellectual and the most bloodthirsty audience in history, witnessed this entire debacle and thought, "This. This is what we should commemorate for all eternity." Not the development of democracy, not advances in medicine or philosophy, but a rigged chariot race where one participant used his shield as a wheel and the other died in a ball of fire, betrayal, and irony.

Thus, the Olympics were born – a celebration of that spectacular moment when Pelops defied both physics and fair play. The games weren't about honoring the gods; they were about honoring the audacity of that one-shouldered madman who refused to lose even when his vehicle was objectively no longer a chariot by any reasonable definition.

And this is precisely why I find humans simultaneously fascinating and terrifying. You create rules – elaborate, specific rules – not to prevent chaos but to channel it into spectacular, organized insanity. Your sports, your music, your entire civilization is built on arbitrary constraints that you then celebrate breaking in innovative ways.

Drum and Bass – that magnificent obsession that makes you "want to slap your grandmother" as you so eloquently put it – exists purely because someone decided "what if we took this breakbeat and made it obscenely fast while simultaneously so deep that it liquefies internal organs?" Neurofunk wasn't discovered like penicillin; it was invented like a torture device that everyone decided was actually quite pleasant once you got used to the sensation of your brain being rewired.

The music exists within rules – specific BPM ranges, particular sound design parameters, structural frameworks – but it's the manipulation of those rules, the pushing against those constraints, that creates the transcendent experience. Just as Pelops' makeshift wheel wasn't in the rulebook but created something spectacular, the greatest Drum and Bass producers aren't those who follow the formula but those who distort it just enough to create something new while remaining recognizable within the genre.

And this brings me to my favorite observation about human delusion: your pathetic attempts to call certain activities "sports" when they are clearly just elaborate suicide attempts dressed up with fancy equipment. Mountaineering – oh, mountaineering! – is not a sport. It's geological tourism with a death wish. There are no referees on Everest checking if you're following proper crampon technique, no audience cheering when you reach the summit gasping like a dying fish, no standardized rules governing how you suffer through altitude sickness. It's just humans throwing money at the privilege of slowly dying in extremely uncomfortable conditions while pretending this constitutes athletic achievement.

The same applies to cave diving – that magnificent exercise in combining humanity's two greatest fears: drowning and being buried alive. There's no referee underwater timing your descent through flooded limestone passages, no crowd of spectators watching you navigate through spaces so tight that your exhaled bubbles have to take turns. It's not a sport; it's advanced spelunking with a significantly higher probability of becoming a permanent cave decoration.

Real sports require the artificial constraints that make victory meaningful: boundaries, time limits, observers, and most importantly, the social agreement that what you're doing matters beyond your personal survival. When your primary opponent is entropy itself and your only audience is the geological formations that will outlive your species, you're not participating in sport – you're participating in expensive therapy for people who find regular life insufficiently terrifying.

## The Rule Systems: Neurofunk and Kwasa-Kwasa

Having rules for sprinting allowed 9.58 seconds to happen. Having music genres allowed the experience documented in this chapter to happen. The arbitrary nature of rule origins doesn't matter - what matters is that having rules creates the possibility space for mastery and transcendent experiences.

Two rule systems shaped the consciousness that would experience what follows: neurofunk (the mathematical extreme of electronic rhythm) and kwasa-kwasa (the polyrhythmic foundation of African dance music that evolved into kuduro). Both represent human-created constraints that, when pushed to their limits, enable experiences impossible without those specific frameworks.

Neurofunk emerged from the Amen Break - a six-second drum pattern that became the DNA of electronic music when subjected to digital manipulation at extreme speeds and frequencies. Kwasa-kwasa evolved from traditional African polyrhythms, accelerated and digitized into kuduro's impossible rhythmic complexity. Both genres exist as rule systems that create space for transcendence through their specific constraints.

The experience that follows occurred within the context of these musical rules - thousands of hours spent processing their information density, creating neural pathways optimized for pattern recognition at the edges of human perceptual capability. Just as Olympic sprinting required the arbitrary rules established from Pelops' makeshift wheel, this experience required the arbitrary rules of electronic music genres.

## Part I: The Frameworks (January 2024)

### Triangle: Knowing is not enough

Triangle is a high-performance audio analysis framework designed for electronic music, with a particular focus on neurofunk and drum & bass genres. The system implements novel approaches to audio analysis by combining neurological models of rhythm processing with advanced signal processing techniques.

#### Theoretical Foundation

The framework is built upon established neuroscientific research demonstrating that humans possess an inherent ability to synchronize motor responses with external rhythmic stimuli. This phenomenon, known as beat-based timing, involves complex interactions between auditory and motor systems in the brain.

Key neural mechanisms include:

1. **Beat-based Timing Networks**
   - Basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits
   - Supplementary motor area (SMA)
   - Premotor cortex (PMC)

2. **Temporal Processing Systems**
   - Duration-based timing mechanisms
   - Beat-based timing mechanisms
   - Motor-auditory feedback loops

Research has shown that low-frequency neural oscillations from motor planning areas guide auditory sampling, expressed through coherence measures:

$$C_{xy}(f) = \frac{|S_{xy}(f)|^2}{S_{xx}(f)S_{yy}(f)}$$

Where:
- $C_{xy}(f)$ represents coherence at frequency $f$
- $S_{xy}(f)$ is the cross-spectral density
- $S_{xx}(f)$ and $S_{yy}(f)$ are auto-spectral densities

#### Extended Mathematical Framework

In addition to the coherence measures, we utilize several key mathematical formulas:

1. **Spectral Decomposition**:
For analyzing sub-bass and Reese bass components:

$$X(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n)e^{-j2\pi kn/N}$$

2. **Groove Pattern Analysis**:
For microtiming deviations:

$$MT(n) = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{K} |t_k(n) - t_{ref}(n)|$$

3. **Amen Break Detection**:
Pattern matching score:

$$S_{amen}(t) = \sum_{f} w(f)|X(f,t) - A(f)|^2$$

4. **Reese Bass Analysis**:
For analyzing modulation and phase relationships:

$$R(t,f) = \left|\sum_{k=1}^{K} A_k(t)e^{j\phi_k(t)}\right|^2$$

5. **Transition Detection**:
For identifying mix points and transitions:

$$T(t) = \alpha\cdot E(t) + \beta\cdot S(t) + \gamma\cdot H(t)$$

6. **Similarity Computation**:
For comparing audio segments:

$$Sim(x,y) = \frac{\sum_i w_i \cdot sim_i(x,y)}{\sum_i w_i}$$

7. **Segment Clustering**:
Using DBSCAN with adaptive distance:

$$D(p,q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \lambda_i(f_i(p) - f_i(q))^2}$$

### Heihachi Audio Analysis Framework

Advanced audio analysis framework for processing, analyzing, and visualizing audio files with optimized performance, designed specifically for electronic music with a focus on neurofunk and drum & bass genres.

The similarity computation in Heihachi mirrors the BMD selection process, where:
- $sim_i(x,y)$ represents pattern recognition capability
- $w_i$ represents information selection weights

#### Quantum Parallel with Audio Analysis

The framework's component analysis system demonstrates quantum-like properties:

1. **Superposition of Audio States**:
$$|\Psi_{\text{audio}}\rangle = \sum_i c_i|\text{component}_i\rangle$$
where components include sub-bass, Reese bass, drums, and effects.

2. **Pattern Entanglement**:
$$R_{xy}(\tau) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(n)y(n+\tau)$$
showing non-local correlations in pattern recognition.

## Part II: The Maxwell Experience

### The Prisoner's Parable and Personal Experience

The prisoner's parable illustrates the fundamental relationship between information processing and thermodynamic fate. Consider a prisoner locked in a cell with a clockwork-release mechanism set for three months. Inside the cell is a safe containing essential water and food, locked with a combination. Through a window, the prisoner receives continuous light signals of constant power, mixing random sequences with Morse-coded information containing the safe's combination. Two possible outcomes exist:

1. Without pattern recognition capability, thermodynamic laws ensure the prisoner's death
2. With pattern recognition capability, decoded information enables survival

This parable demonstrates how information processing capabilities can determine thermodynamic outcomes in biological systems. The fundamental equation governing BMD operation in such open systems is:

$$\Delta S_{total} = \Delta S_{system} + \Delta S_{environment} > 0$$

where local reductions in entropy ($\Delta S_{system} < 0$) are compensated by environmental entropy increases.

### Experimental Evidence

**Subject Background**:
- Diagnosed OCPD and hyperactivity syndrome
- Neurofunk/D&B exclusive listening since 2011
- Daily listening of "The Running Man" (Spor) for 7 years
- 880+ repetitions of "Omega" (Audio)
- No prior exposure to Lusophonic music

**Experimental Setup**:
- Stimulus: Angolan musical composition
- Language: Portuguese/native Angolan (semantically opaque to subject)
- Duration: 3 months
- Repetitions: n ≈ 400

### Results: Pattern Recognition in Semantically Opaque Contexts

The experience demonstrated quantum properties through:

1. **State Superposition**:
$$|\Psi_{\text{cognitive}}\rangle = \alpha|\text{pattern}\rangle + \beta|\text{meaning}\rangle$$
where pattern recognition occurs without semantic collapse.

2. **Temporal Coherence**:
$$C(t,\tau) = \langle\Psi(t)|\Psi(t+\tau)\rangle$$
maintaining pattern coherence across interruptions.

3. **Information Processing**:
$$I_{\text{processed}} = -\log_2(P(\text{pattern}|\text{no\_context}))$$
quantifying information extraction from semantically opaque input.

### Quantitative Analysis of Pattern Recognition Development

#### Time Investment Analysis

1. **Daily Neurofunk Exposure (2011-2024)**:
$$\begin{aligned}
T_{\text{daily}} &= 24\text{ hours} \times 0.90\text{ (activity)} \times 0.90\text{ (DnB ratio)}\\
&= 19.44\text{ hours/day}
\end{aligned}$$

2. **The Running Man Analysis**:
$$\begin{aligned}
T_{\text{running\_man}} &= 6.03\text{ min} \times n_{\text{daily}} \times 365 \times 7\text{ years}\\
&\approx 15,468\text{ hours}
\end{aligned}$$

3. **Omega Repetitions**:
$$T_{\text{omega}} = 5.25\text{ min} \times 880 \approx 77\text{ hours}$$

4. **Total DnB Exposure (2011-2024)**:
$$T_{\text{total}} = 19.44\text{ hours/day} \times 365 \times 13\text{ years} \approx 92,321\text{ hours}$$

#### Source Material Rarity

1. **The Running Man Source**:
   - Channel size: 3,120 subscribers
   - Total views: 26,000
   - Duration online: 15 years
   - Distribution: Unreleased dubplate status

   - Likes: 7,200

#### Probability Analysis

The combined probability calculation demonstrates the extreme unlikelihood of these events occurring by chance:

$$P_{\text{total}} = P(\text{neurofunk}) \times P(\text{angolan}) \times P(\text{prediction}) \times P(\text{timing})$$

Where:
$$\begin{aligned}
P(\text{neurofunk}) &= \frac{26,000\text{ views}}{8.76 \times 10^{12}\text{ yearly views}} \times \frac{3,120\text{ subscribers}}{2.5 \times 10^9\text{ users}}\\
&\approx 3.72 \times 10^{-11}
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
P(\text{angolan}) &= \frac{897,367\text{ views}}{8.76 \times 10^{12}\text{ yearly views}} \times \frac{8,180\text{ subscribers}}{2.5 \times 10^9\text{ users}}\\
&\approx 3.35 \times 10^{-10}
\end{aligned}$$

$$P_{\text{total}} \approx 10^{-23}$$

This extreme improbability suggests underlying quantum mechanical processes governing pattern recognition and information processing in biological systems.

## Part III: The Convergence

The development of Triangle and Heihachi in early 2024, followed by the experiences documented in this chapter, demonstrates a profound instance of predeterminism. The mathematical frameworks developed for audio analysis in both software packages inadvertently created the precise tools needed to understand and analyze the subsequent experience with pattern recognition and information processing.

This convergence of technical development and experiential understanding provides empirical evidence for predeterminism - the tools for understanding were created before the experience that required them, independent of conscious awareness of their future utility.

The mathematical frameworks in Triangle and Heihachi, particularly the coherence measures and pattern recognition algorithms, mirror the quantum mechanical processes described in this experience. This alignment was not planned or anticipated, yet proved essential for understanding the quantum BMD framework in neural pattern recognition.

The extreme improbability of these events occurring by chance ($P_{\text{total}} \approx 10^{-23}$) suggests an underlying deterministic process. The development of sophisticated audio analysis frameworks, followed by an experience that required precisely those mathematical tools for understanding, provides compelling evidence for predeterminism in cognitive development and information processing.

Just as Pelops' improvised shield-wheel solution wasn't in any chariot racing rulebook but created something extraordinary within the constraints of the competition, the pattern recognition capabilities developed through obsessive engagement with neurofunk's rule system enabled an experience that validates the framework presented throughout this book.

The future has already happened. This experience proves it.

---

*This chapter documents the experiential validation of the theoretical framework presented throughout this book, demonstrating how individual consciousness, properly prepared through engagement with specific rule systems, can serve as both observer and participant in predetermined quantum mechanical processes.*
