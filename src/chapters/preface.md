# We pray that we are wrong

We hope that the contents of this framework can be disproven. Being rendered clinically insane, and getting an ID card for insanity as a compliment should be sweeter than Italian wine, the equivalent of having to cut plastic with scissors all day long. The situation here is straight forward, its either the framework is true and complete, or, I am the most sophisticated clown that has ever existed, and shall exist. A clown that is not even funny, at all. 

We pray that we are wrong.

We pray that you can prove it.
