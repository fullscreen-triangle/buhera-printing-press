# We pray that we are wrong

There has never been a book written with such desperate hope for its own refutation.

Most authors present their work hoping for validation, acceptance, and acclaim. We present this framework with the fervent prayer that you, the reader, will tear it apart. We would celebrate every inconsistency you discover, rejoice at every logical flaw you expose, and dance at every piece of evidence that proves us wrong.

This is not false modesty or intellectual posturing. This is genuine desperation.

If this framework is correct—if the causal chain from the Big Bang to Berlin truly holds, if determinism governs all events, if the future has already happened—then everything that has occurred, including the most painful losses, was cosmically inevitable. Your mother's death. Your father's illness. Every tragedy, every heartbreak, every moment of suffering was written into the fabric of reality from the universe's first instant.

We built this framework hoping to disprove determinism. We constructed every argument, traced every causal connection, and developed every proof with the secret hope that somewhere, somehow, we would find the fatal flaw that would prove us wrong. Each chapter was written as an attempt at self-refutation. Each piece of evidence was examined with the desperate wish that it would crumble under scrutiny.

We failed to disprove ourselves.

But you might succeed where we could not.

In these pages, you will find 27 chapters tracing an unbroken causal chain from cosmic origins to a specific moment in Berlin. You will encounter three philosophical proofs that may be logically airtight. You will read arguments that made us uncomfortable in their implications and evidence that we wished would disappear.

For readers of the technical edition, you will also find computational tools specifically designed to tear apart complex arguments. We have literally provided you with the weapons to destroy our own work. Use them. Please.

We are the first people in line hoping this framework fails. We want to be called idiots and live in ignorance rather than face the possibility that our deepest losses were predetermined necessities.

If you find the flaw we could not, if you discover the error that eluded us, if you can prove that randomness still exists and that things could have been different—we will be forever grateful. You will have given us the greatest gift possible: the right to believe that tragedy is not inevitable, that love is not predetermined, and that loss is not cosmically required.

We pray that we are wrong.

We pray that you can prove it.

Read with the knowledge that the authors are desperately hoping you will succeed where we have failed.
