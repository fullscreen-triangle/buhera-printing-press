# Supersonic Marine Propulsion: The Hydrofoil-to-Ekranoplane Transition Vehicle

## Introduction to Marine Speed Limitations

Traditional marine speed records remain significantly below sonic velocities, with the Spirit of Australia holding the record at approximately 511 km/h. However, by fundamentally redefining the vessel-medium relationship, theoretical analysis suggests potential speeds of Mach 3-5 (≈3700 km/h) through a novel supersonic hydrofoil-to-ekranoplane transition vehicle (SHETV).

## Theoretical Framework

### 1. Transition Dynamics
The hydrofoil-to-ekranoplane transition follows:

$$L_{total} = L_{hydrofoil}(v) + L_{wing}(v,h)$$

Transition progression:
$$L_{hydrofoil} \gg L_{wing} \text{ (initial)} \rightarrow L_{wing} \gg L_{hydrofoil} \text{ (final)}$$

### 2. Ground Effect Enhancement

$$\frac{L}{L_{\infty}} \approx 1 + \frac{c}{16h}$$

Where:
- $L$ = Ground effect lift
- $L_{\infty}$ = Free-flight lift
- $c$ = Wing chord length
- $h$ = Height above surface

### 3. Dynamic Pressure Systems

Stagnation pressure relation:
$$p_0 = p_\infty \left(1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^2\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}$$

Applications:
1. Closed-Loop Cooling

   - Stagnation point compression
   - Self-regulating thermal management

2. Secondary Propulsion
   $$F_{pressure} = \int_{S} (p - p_\infty) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS$$
